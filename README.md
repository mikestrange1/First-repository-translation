feudal life translation

**Project Details**
Life is Feudal is a hardcore Sandbox RPG and MMORPG game which is in Medieval times. The game is a blend of history and fantasy to make players  feel realism while playing it.  I like to play this kind of games and I decided to be a part of this project to add value since I cannot program it. So, if you like playing games, you can help in translation to languages you know.
